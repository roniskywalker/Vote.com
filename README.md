3. Run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This command will start Zookeeper, Kafka and Postgres containers in detached mode (`-d` flag). Kafka will be accessible at `localhost:9092` and Postgres at `localhost:5432`.

##### Additional Configuration
If you need to modify Zookeeper configurations or change the exposed port, you can update the `docker-compose.yml` file according to your requirements.

### Running the App
1. Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Creating the required tables on Postgres and generating voter information on Kafka topic:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Consuming the voter information from Kafka topic, generating voting data and producing data to Kafka topic:

```bash
python voting.py
```

4. Consuming the voting data from Kafka topic, enriching the data from Postgres and producing data to specific topics on Kafka:

```bash
python spark-streaming.py
```

5. Running the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit-app.py
